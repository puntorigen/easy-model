Let's dive in and see how async-easy-model can transform your development workflow!

## Getting Started

First things first, let's install the package:

```bash
pip install async-easy-model
```

### Configure Your Database Connection

Start by configuring your database connection:

```python
from async_easy_model import db_config

# SQLite setup (great for development)
db_config.configure_sqlite("database.db")

# Or PostgreSQL for production
db_config.configure_postgres(
    user="your_user",
    password="your_password",
    host="localhost",
    port="5432",
    database="your_database"
)
```

### Define Your Models

After setting up your connection, define your models:

```python
from async_easy_model import EasyModel, Field
from typing import Optional

# Define your models
class User(EasyModel, table=True):
    username: str = Field(unique=True)
    email: str
    is_active: bool = Field(default=True)

# Define other models...
```

### Initialize Your Database

Finally, initialize your database after all your models have been defined:

```python
from async_easy_model import init_db

async def setup():
    # Always call init_db() after all your models have been defined
    await init_db()  # This is where the magic happens!
```

## Defining Your Models

Model definition is clean and intuitive:

```python
# User model with automatic timestamps
class User(EasyModel, table=True):
    username: str = Field(unique=True)
    email: str
    is_active: bool = Field(default=True)
    
# Blog post with relationship to user
class Post(EasyModel, table=True):
    title: str
    content: str
    user_id: Optional[int] = Field(default=None, foreign_key="user.id")
    
# Comment with relationships to post and user
class Comment(EasyModel, table=True):
    text: str
    post_id: Optional[int] = Field(default=None, foreign_key="post.id")
    user_id: Optional[int] = Field(default=None, foreign_key="user.id")
```

Notice what's missing? You don't need to explicitly define:

- Primary key fields (`id`)
- Timestamp fields (`created_at`, `updated_at`)
- Relationship attributes

async-easy-model provides these automatically!

## CRUD Operations Made Simple

Let's explore how async-easy-model simplifies database operations.

### Creating Records

```python
# Creating a single user
user = await User.insert({
    "username": "jane_doe",
    "email": "jane@example.com"
})
print(f"Created user with ID: {user.id}")

# Creating multiple records at once
products = await Product.insert([
    {"name": "Ergonomic Keyboard", "price": 89.99},
    {"name": "Wireless Mouse", "price": 49.99},
    {"name": "Monitor Stand", "price": 29.99}
])
print(f"Created {len(products)} products")

# Creating with relationships
post = await Post.insert({
    "title": "Why async-easy-model is Amazing",
    "content": "Let me count the ways...",
    "user": {"username": "jane_doe"}  # Automatically links to existing user
})
print(f"Created post with title: {post.title} by user: {post.user.username}")
```

### Reading Records

Here's where async-easy-model really shines with its flexible, intuitive query methods:

```python
# Get by ID (single record)
user = await User.select({"id": 1})

# Get all records
all_users = await User.select({}, all=True)
# Or the more expressive shorthand:
all_users = await User.all()

# Get with criteria
active_users = await User.select({"is_active": True}, all=True)

# Pattern matching with wildcards
gmail_users = await User.select({"email": "*@gmail.com"}, all=True)

# Get first matching record
first_user = await User.first()

# Limit results
latest_users = await User.limit(5)

# Order results (ascending by default)
alphabetical_users = await User.all(order_by="username")

# Order results (descending)
newest_users = await User.all(order_by="-created_at")

# Order by multiple fields
sorted_users = await User.all(order_by=["last_name", "first_name"])

# Order by relationship fields
posts_by_author = await Post.all(order_by="user.username")

# Select with relationship criteria
admin_posts = await Post.select({"user": {"role": "admin"}}, all=True)
```

### Updating Records

```python
# Update by ID
updated_user = await User.update({"email": "updated@example.com"}, 1)
print(f"Updated user email to: {updated_user.email}")

# Update by criteria
count = await User.update(
    {"is_active": False},
    {"last_login": None}  # Update all users who haven't logged in
)
print(f"Deactivated {count} inactive users")

# Update with nested relationship fields
await User.update(
    {
        "profile": {"bio": "Python developer and async enthusiast"},
        "settings": {"notifications": True}
    },
    {"username": "jane_doe"}
)
```

### Deleting Records

```python
# Delete by ID
success = await User.delete(1)
if success:
    print("User deleted successfully")

# Delete by criteria
deleted_count = await User.delete({"is_active": False})
print(f"Deleted {deleted_count} inactive users")

# Delete with relationship criteria
await Comment.delete({"post": {"title": "Outdated Post"}})
```

## The Magic of Automatic Relationships

One of the most powerful features of async-easy-model is its automatic relationship handling. When you define foreign keys, the package automatically sets up bidirectional relationships between your models.

```python
# Define your models with foreign keys
class Department(EasyModel, table=True):
    name: str

class Employee(EasyModel, table=True):
    name: str
    department_id: Optional[int] = Field(default=None, foreign_key="department.id")

# Initialize the database 
await init_db()

# Now you can use relationships automatically!
department = await Department.insert({"name": "Engineering"})
employee = await Employee.insert({
    "name": "John Doe", 
    "department_id": department.id
})

# Access relationships directly
employee = await Employee.select({"id": employee.id})  # Relationships are loaded by default
print(f"{employee.name} works in the {employee.department.name} department")

# Access in the reverse direction too
department = await Department.select({"id": department.id})
print(f"The {department.name} department has {len(department.employees)} employees")
```

### Working with Relationships Like a Pro

async-easy-model provides several ways to work with relationships efficiently:

```python
# Load specific relationships for better performance
user = await User.get_with_related(1, ["posts", "comments"])

# Load relationships after fetching
user = await User.select({"id": 1}, include_relationships=False)
await user.load_related(["posts", "comments"])

# Insert with nested relationships
new_post = await Post.insert({
    "title": "Working with Relationships",
    "content": "It's easier than you think!",
    "user": {"id": 1},  # Link by ID
    "comments": [
        {"text": "Great post!", "user": {"username": "fan1"}},
        {"text": "Very helpful", "user": {"username": "fan2"}}
    ]
})

# Access nested data immediately without requerying
print(f"Post by {new_post.user.username} with {len(new_post.comments)} comments")
print(f"First comment by: {new_post.comments[0].user.username}")

# Convert to dictionary with relationships included (default)
post_dict = new_post.to_dict(include_relationships=True)
```

## The Miracle of Automatic Migrations

Here's where async-easy-model truly stands out: **automatic schema migrations without Alembic!**

The package tracks your model definitions with hash codes. When you modify your models and call `init_db()`, it automatically:

1. Detects changes in your model definitions
2. Generates the necessary migration operations
3. Applies them to your database schema

Let's see this in action:

```python
# First, configure database connection
db_config.configure_sqlite("database.db")

# Then, define your models
class Product(EasyModel, table=True):
    name: str
    price: float = Field(gt=0)

# Finally, initialize database after models are defined
await init_db()

# Later, you decide to add a new field
class Product(EasyModel, table=True):
    name: str
    price: float = Field(gt=0)
    description: Optional[str] = Field(default=None)  # New field
    in_stock: bool = Field(default=True)  # Another new field

# Just call init_db() again and the migration happens automatically!
# This must happen after the updated model definitions
migration_results = await init_db()
print("Migration applied:", migration_results)
```

No Alembic scripts, no migration versions to track, no complex commands to run. Just update your models and run your application!

## Real-World Example: Building a Blog API

Let's see how async-easy-model simplifies building a real-world application:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException
from async_easy_model import EasyModel, init_db, db_config, Field
from typing import Optional, List
from pydantic import BaseModel

# First, configure database connection
db_config.configure_sqlite("blog.db")

# Then, define models
class User(EasyModel, table=True):
    username: str = Field(unique=True)
    email: str
    
class Post(EasyModel, table=True):
    title: str
    content: str
    published: bool = Field(default=False)
    user_id: Optional[int] = Field(default=None, foreign_key="user.id")
    
class Comment(EasyModel, table=True):
    content: str
    post_id: Optional[int] = Field(default=None, foreign_key="post.id")
    user_id: Optional[int] = Field(default=None, foreign_key="user.id")

# Define API schemas
class PostCreate(BaseModel):
    title: str
    content: str
    published: bool = False

class PostResponse(BaseModel):
    id: int
    title: str
    content: str
    published: bool
    created_at: str
    author: str

# Initialize FastAPI
app = FastAPI(title="Blog API")

@app.on_event("startup")
async def startup():
    # Initialize db after all models have been defined
    await init_db()
    
    # Create default user if none exists
    if not await User.first():
        await User.insert({
            "username": "admin",
            "email": "admin@example.com"
        })

@app.get("/posts", response_model=List[PostResponse])
async def get_posts():
    # Get all published posts, ordered by newest first
    posts = await Post.select({"published": True}, order_by="-created_at", all=True)
    
    # Convert to response format
    return [
        PostResponse(
            id=post.id,
            title=post.title,
            content=post.content,
            published=post.published,
            created_at=post.created_at.isoformat(),
            author=post.user.username
        ) for post in posts
    ]

@app.post("/posts", response_model=PostResponse)
async def create_post(post_data: PostCreate):
    # Get the admin user
    admin = await User.first()
    
    # Create the post with relationship
    post = await Post.insert({
        "title": post_data.title,
        "content": post_data.content,
        "published": post_data.published,
        "user_id": admin.id
    })
    
    # Load the user relationship
    await post.load_related("user")
    
    # Return the response
    return PostResponse(
        id=post.id,
        title=post.title,
        content=post.content,
        published=post.published,
        created_at=post.created_at.isoformat(),
        author=post.user.username
    )
```
